								<h3>• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
								<p>I am interested in developing video games. Three years ago, the famous video game "Dark Souls" from FROMSOFTWARE company sparked my interest in making video games. From that on, making a virtual world is very attractive to me. Now, I am learning Unity by myself to realize my dream.</p>
								<h3>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
								<p>RMIT has a sufficiently excellent teaching environment, I believe I can learn anything I want in RMIT. Another reason is that Melbourne is one of my favorite cities and I am so happy to study here.</p>
								<h3>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
								<p>As I said, I am interested in developing video games, so I want to learn about Unity and other Game Engines, such as Unreal Engine.</p>

								<p>Link: https://www.ecareer.ne.jp/positions/00037995002/218</p>
								<p>Cygames is a game company that produces a lot of well-known smartphone games. This work is to develop console games, which is a new field for Cygames, they have just begun to enter this field. The content of this job are development of console game title-specific processing, Game event control, Character control and UI control.</p>
							    <p>This work is in Osaka, Japan, which is a Japanese cultural center. Here, I can easily access the latest cultural products in the world. I believe it will help me to come up with new ideas.</p>
								<p>This job requires me to understand game AI technology and be proficient in C and C++ languages. In addition, having experience in game development using commercial game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4 will be helpful. Of course, it is better to have a heart that likes games and is willing to communicate and cooperate with other colleagues.</p>
								<p>Now, I am a beginner in Unity engine, and I have learned C language. I don't know anything about game AI, and I have no experience in game development, but I am passionate about games, I would like to learn anything I need.</p>
								<p>For now, as I can, I would try to learn all of Unity and related knowledges, then I would try to develop some games or APPs by myself to improve my level in my university. After that, in order to meet the requirements, if possible, I would go to a small game company to gain the experience.</p>

								<h3>The results of my online Myers-briggs test:<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">Result link</a></h3>

								<h3>The results of my online learning style test:<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=8&V=9&T=3">Result link</a></h3>
								<p>Auditory: 40%, visual: 45%,Tactile: 15%</p>

								<h3>• How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>My project will be a sandbox computer game with a high degree of freedom, in which players can use the resources in the game to create and modify anything they want. Players will enjoy exploring unknown areas randomly generated by the system, and use the rewards obtained from exploration to build their own homes. It's a bit like "Minecraft", but the artistic style will be more realistic. Just like most ordinary PC games, players can use the keyboard, mouse and gamepad to play. In addition, this game will be playable using VR devices. </p>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>Sandbox games are currently one of the most attractive games. "The Legend of Zelda", "Minecraft" and "Ark Evolved Survival" are now very popular sandbox games, especially "Minecraft", which has sold more than 176 million copies and it is the best-selling game of all time, many people enjoy this type of game. This type of game is not like those games that set tasks to be completed by the player. In this type of game, players can set their own goals to complete, such as building a house or collecting some items. They let players use their imagination, which is why they are attractive. This project will contain many different planets, each with a different style of environment and creatures. For players, this will be a brand new attractive world.</p>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>At the beginning of the game, the player will be randomly born in the wild of the first planet with a certain hit point and a set of values representing the player's ability. Over time, if the player does not eat food, the player's hunger level will decrease. When it drops to a certain level, it will affect the player's mobility and even death. At the same time, there may be some creatures that will attack and kill the player. Therefore, in order to survive, players should try to find food and shelter. In order to better obtain food and shelter, players may need some tools. They can collect some rattans and sticks from plants in the game to make necessary tools. By using this tool, players can easily obtain more useful resources, such as stone and wood, so that they can build their own shelter. For long-term survival, players can also grow some crops or feed some edible creatures to obtain a stable source of food. When players have enough resources, they can explore their planet. The first planet will restore the earth’s environment as much as possible. There will be many different landforms in the first planet such as desert, forest, ocean, volcano. </p>
								<p>However, this is not the all of the game. In addition to exploring on the planet, players can also develop technology. Players can build laboratories and workshops to develop the technology tree owned by players. The higher the level of these buildings, the more complex things players can create, such as vehicles, computers and even spacecraft. When the player makes a spacecraft that can leave the first planet, the second stage of the game begins. Players can control the spacecraft to go to any place before the spacecraft runs out of fuel. When they reach another planet, they will discover a completely different world. It may be a desert planet with stone and sand, or a planet full of sea water, or a strange planet with all kinds of strange creatures and even dangerous monsters. Players can start new adventures on those planets. As players explore further, they will obtain a variety of new resources, which will further develop their technology tree. As a result, they will be able to create advanced technology products, such as robots that can follow player commands, portals that can teleport anything to a set location, and even Dyson balls that can get energy from stars. Future technologies that only exist in sci-fi movies will be present in this game.</p>
								<p>In addition, this game is also a multiplayer online game. Players can invite their friends to play together on their planet. At the same time, players can also set up their own servers and play games with other strangers. In the case, players can work together or fight with each other. This will be a different experience than playing alone. </p>
								<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
								<p>To build the basic framework of the game, I need to use Unity3D. I need to use C# language and very complex algorithms to generate random maps, I need so Visual Studio 2019. In order to achieve a real physics system, I will use Havok as the physics engine for this game. Many 3D models are needed, so Blender will be the tool for building them. In order to realize the multiplayer game mode, I also need a powerful server to provide players with a good online experience. </p>
								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<p>This project need a lot of skills, it should be done by a team. First of all, I need to be proficient in the use of unity3d and C# language to ensure that the game can be built. Secondly, the use of Havok physical system and a lot of algorithms are required. Then, I need to be proficient in using blender to model and write a lot of motion data. Server installation and management are also necessary.Mastering all these skills is a huge challenge, and it takes a lot of work to master them, but it is still feasible.</p>
								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>If this project is successful, then this may be the richest sandbox game ever. However, the difficulty of realizing this project is very high. The initial problem may be insufficient funds. Therefore, this project requires high investment to realize. If everything can be solved, and this game can enter the field of vision of players, then it will be highly discussed on the Internet. When playing this game, players should experience an unprecedented feeling, and even trigger thinking about the relationship between man and the universe.</p>
